# data-info Endpoints

All URLs referenced in endpoint documentation are listed as relative URLs with
value names enclosed in braces. For example, the service to get a list of
workflow elements is accessed using the URL,
`/get-workflow-elements/{element-type}`. Where `{element-type}` refers to the
type of workflow element that is being retrieved. For example, to get a list of
known property types, you can access the URL,
`/get-workflow-elements/property-types`. On the other hand, all examples use
fully qualified URLs.

Request and response bodies are in JSON format unless otherwise noted.
